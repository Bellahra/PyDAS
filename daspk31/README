Before using, dump the contents of the solver folder in DASPK3.1 into this folder.  
The files present should be as follows:
    adf_dummy.f
    daux.f
    ddaskr.f
    ddaspk.f
    dlinpk.f
    dsensd.f
    mpi_dummy.f

Making the PyDAS package will compile the fortran code as well as PyDAS wrappers.  
Use the 'make daspk31' command in the parent folder to compile the fortran code for
daspk31 only.
